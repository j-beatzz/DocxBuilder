# DocxBuilder (WIP)

DocxBuilder is a Java application to automate the process of creating multiple Microsoft word documents from a single document template while updating variables in the template with values from a CSV file.

The test csv file has been autogenerated using [Mockaroo](https://www.mockaroo.com/)
Parsing of Microsoft Word Documents has been done in part using [Docx4j](http://www.docx4java.org/) I hope to do this part myself soon. It will be a nice challenge!

## Why?
Cuz I wanted to ;). No really, I just wanted to butress my understanding of the reader/writer problem.

## Use
Right now, there is no great way to make use of this application. (That's why it's a WIP). For now, you can import it to eclipse and run as a Java Application to see it do its work.

## Next Steps
- [x] Harness the powers of concurrency.
- [ ] Make the program executable on a terminal
